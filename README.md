# FPLA customised version of CCD Docker :whale: 

- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Quick start](#quick-start)
- [Elastic search](#elastic-search)
- [License](#license)

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)

*Memory and CPU allocations may need to be increased for successful execution of ccd applications altogether*

- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) - minimum version 2.0.57 
- [jq Json Processor](https://stedolan.github.io/jq)

## Quick start
Login to the Azure Container registry:

```bash
./ccd login
```
Note:
if you experience any error with the above command, try `az login` first

Make sure 'sidam', 'sidam-local', 'sidam-local-ccd' docker compose files are enabled. How you do that depends on your currently active compose files. When no active compose files are present, the default ones are executed. But if there's any active, then the defautl ones are ignored. For example:

```shell script
./ccd enable show

Currently active compose files:
backend
frontend

Default compose files:
backend
frontend
sidam
sidam-local
sidam-local-ccd
elasticsearch
```
If you do not have the desired output you can disable active compose files using the following command where each compose file you want deactivated is defined: 

```shell script
./ccd disable backend frontend ...
```

or enable the correct compose files using:

```shell script
./ccd enable backend frontend sidam sidam-local sidam-local-ccd elasticsearch
```

Pulling latest Docker images:

```bash
./ccd compose pull
```

Creating and starting the containers:

```bash
./ccd compose up -d
```

Scripts to create FPLA test users are located in bin directory.

To add services: 

```
 IDAM_ADMIN_USER=<enter email> IDAM_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<enter password> ./bin/add-services.sh
```

To add roles required to import ccd definition: 

```
 IDAM_ADMIN_USER=<enter email> IDAM_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<enter password> ./bin/add-roles.sh
```

To add users: 

```
./bin/add-users.sh
```

`IDAM_ADMIN_USER` and `IDAM_ADMIN_PASSWORD` details can be found on confluence.

To enable stubbing of the ```PROXY_PAYMENTS``` set the ```PROXY_PAYMENTS_STUB``` environment variable to the desired url. 

## Elastic search

### Information
`compose/elasticsearch.yml` has been updated with specific fpla logstash image: `hmcts/ccd-logstash:fpla`. This image
was generated using [ccd-logastash](https://github.com/hmcts/ccd-logstash) repository and will only work where 
`Jurisdiction = ADOPTION`. 

Please see `packer_images` directory in the logstash repo and specific adoption files for further info.

When adding a CCD definition file elastic search indexes will be created. To verify, you can hit the elastic search
api directly on `localhost:9200` with the following command. It will return all stored indexes.
```shell script
curl -X GET http://localhost:9200/adoption_cases
```

The following command will return all cases currently indexed.
```shell script
 curl -X GET http://localhost:9200/adoption_cases/_search
```

Note: if you start elastic search after having existing cases, these cases will not be searchable using ES.

---

### CoreCaseDataApi Elastic Search Endpoint

You can search on local envs using this endpoint: `localhost:4452/searchCases?ctid=ADOPTION`

An example of a JSON search query which would return any cases where the reference is 1234: 
```json
{
    "query": {
        "match" : {
          "reference" : "1234"
        }
    }
}
```

Please see [ES docs - start searching](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/getting-started-search.html) for more
examples of search queries.

Example curl: 
```shell script
curl --location --request POST 'localhost:4452/searchCases?ctid=ADOPTION' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: <auth-token> \
--header 'ServiceAuthorization: <service-auth-token> \
--data-raw '{
  "query": {
    "match" : {
      "reference" : "1234"
    }
  }
}'
```

Example response: 
```json
{
    "total": 1,
    "cases": [
        {
            "id": 1234,
            "jurisdiction": "ADOPTION",
            "state": "Open",
            "version": null,
            "case_type_id": "ADOPTION",
            "created_date": "2020-03-09T16:05:01.742",
            "last_modified": "2020-03-09T16:05:01.745",
            "security_classification": "PUBLIC",
            "case_data": {},
            "data_classification": {
                "creatorId": "PUBLIC"
            },
            "after_submit_callback_response": null,
            "callback_response_status_code": null,
            "callback_response_status": null,
            "delete_draft_response_status_code": null,
            "delete_draft_response_status": null,
            "security_classifications": {
                "creatorId": "PUBLIC"
            }
        }
    ]
}
